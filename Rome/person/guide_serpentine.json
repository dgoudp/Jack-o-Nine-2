"dialog":["The residential Zone of the Serpentine quarter is called anthill because of the incredibly high population density and development. The Serpis Great House, under whose jurisdiction this district is, has a lot of subjects. Unfortunately, due to the crowding, a lot of crimes are committed.",
"If you are low on money and do not want to spend extra sparks, anthill will be a good choice. Yes, the apartments here are small, but very cheap. And the situation for people is still less dangerous than in the quarter of the Outcasts. Plus, a Technosphere and an Illusory Sea is nearby."]
