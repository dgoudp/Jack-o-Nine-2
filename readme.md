# Jack-o-Nine-2

### Info

This is the source code with development to the game name Jack-o-Nine-2.  
A remake of original game titled Jack-o-nine-tails, created by [Old Huntsman][] licensed as [Copyleft][].

### Development

The project will be taking its main development occurring here in this github repository.  
[Gfurst]\(me\) is leading development and accepts contributors. If you want to help out you, check the wiki [contribute page](../../wiki/contribute). For a quick guide on how to [operate git](../../wiki/gitguide).

The main development discussion is taking place at [HongFire], there we aim to organize goals, discuss features and analyze original game to port them. Another place for discussion is at the [issues page](../../issues), which is a better way to track discussion and progress on specific features/improvements/bugs/and whatever. Still lots of useful development documentation should be found at the [wiki](../../wiki).

### Godot Engine

The engine I've chosen for this is called [Godot][]. Its a very nice, open-source and cross-platform, development engine with SDK(software development kit). This is has built-in editor for any visual element and script writer with auto-fill and error check. It has its own scripting language that is very much based on Python, called [GDscript][], high-level and very easy to use. Several built-in classes for all our needs.
